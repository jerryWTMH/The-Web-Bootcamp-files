This repo is my code for the Udemy course: The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020

And I changed the code to personalize these little projects

Chapter 21: circles.html (it is the music interaction web game, you can type different keys between A-Z and get the different color bubbles and special sound.)

Chapter 9: project1.html (I share the beautiful photos about my future school: Duke University, by making this web code, I hope I could let more people know the beauty of my school.)

Chapter 17: colorgame.html ()
