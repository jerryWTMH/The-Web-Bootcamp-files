# The-Web-Bootcamp-files
This repo is my code for the Udemy course: The Web Developer Bootcamp 2020

And I changed the code to personalize these little projects~

- **Chapter 9: project1.html** (I share the beautiful photos about my future school: Duke University, by making this web code, I hope I could let more people know the beauty of my school.)

- **Chapter 9: project2.html** (A stylish dessert shop webpage, it could change the method of text aligning when you decreate the width of the web page.)

- **Chapter 17: colorgame.html** (It is the guessing color game.)

- **Chapter 21: circles.html** (It is the music interaction web game, you can type different keys between A-Z and get the different color bubbles and special sound.)
